These collections of files can together argumentatively classify transcript docx files, and were created by Maurits Politiek (2017).
To execute the classification process, one must run Total.py (via the command line), followed by the transcript that is to be analyzed. 
The docx extension of the transcript need not be added. Python has to be installed in order to run the code.
An example of an execution is the command:

python Total.py Group_01_Transcript

This returns a txt file in the main folder, with the classified tags and their according sentences. The sentences only appear when they are 
argumentative and contain a tag that is either premise, claim or both.
